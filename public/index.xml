      <description>The end of procrastination is the art of letting go. I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.&#xA;Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

      <description>Hey there, everyone! I just wrapped up an unforgettable trip to Pune, where I had the chance to reconnect with some of my old classmates and friends from the days of yore (of long ago or former times). It&amp;rsquo;s been three to four days of catching up, reminiscing, and rediscovering some precious moments from our shared past. But let me tell you, this journey has led me to some profound reflections on how we often judge people based on their history.</description>

      <description>“The mind is what we use to perceive the world. We don’t see things as they are, we see things as we are.“&#xA;As a society, it’s all too easy to focus on our external achievements and forget to assess whether we are happy with the state of our life.&#xA;We tend to take everyone at face value, equating what they have on the outside to how they feel on the inside.</description>
