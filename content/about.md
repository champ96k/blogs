I'm Tushar Nikam, I hold a **B.Tech** degree in **Computer Science** from **Savitribai Phule Pune University**. I'm a **software developer** and **computer programmer** with an avid interest in **Mobile application development**. As a core programmer, I love taking on challenges and **love** being part of the solution.

Would be interested in getting exposure to domains providing intellectually challenging work in the field of computers for proving and enriching my knowledge and skills.
