### August 2023 Now

Currently working as a **Software engineer** at [Adda52](https://www.adda.games), trying to provide a hassle-free **multiplatform gaming** experience for **millions** of users.

Trying to get better at technical writing, and learning stuffs, along with i also documenting my **development journey**. 

I am currently reading these two books: **Atomic habit** and **Computer Science Distilled**: *Learn the Art of Solving Computational Problems*

When Iâ€™m home, I mostly surf the *web* a lot and watch movies/series, and a documentary on Netflix, Prime Video, **discovery plus**, and much more.
