Hey there, everyone! I just wrapped up an unforgettable trip to Pune, where I had the chance to reconnect with some of my old classmates and friends from the days of yore (of long ago or former times). It's been three to four days of catching up, reminiscing, and rediscovering some precious moments from our shared past. But let me tell you, this journey has led me to some profound reflections on how we often judge people based on their history.

We all have our own stories, and life takes us down different paths. In our school days, it's easy to be labeled as a "dropout" or a "duffer" if you struggle academically or choose a unique path. But what people don't realize is how much we can change and grow over time. Our past doesn't define us, and it certainly doesn't determine our future.

Over these past few days, as I reconnected with my old friend, I couldn't help but feel like they were still viewing me through the lens of our school days. It's disheartening to think that they might see me as that same person from years ago, when I've evolved, learned, and pursued my passions.

As we spent two days together, it became increasingly evident that their perspectives remained rooted in the past. They measured me based on who I was back then, rather than the person I've become today. It was a stark reminder that, sometimes, we outgrow certain relationships and friendships, not because we hold any judgment against them, but because they are unwilling to change their perceptions.

Saying goodbye to these old friend after this reunion was bittersweet. On one hand, there was an immense feeling of nostalgia and affection for the memories we once created together (Ohh we don't created any memories yet, thank god!). On the other, it was a poignant realization that our paths have diverged too far. I've decided not to meet them again, not out of resentment, but because it's important for me to surround myself with individuals who appreciate the person I am today, rather than the one I used to be.

But there's more to this story. The primary reason for my visit was to meet one friend, someone I had never met in person before. I wanted to understand her, to break down the illusions that had built up around our online interactions. However, as the days passed, I began to realize that the feeling of missing someone you've never met can be quite powerful. It's like longing for a stranger who, in your mind, feels like a dear friend.

As the visit drew to a close, it struck me that it's better to meet this friend in person, to clear the illusions and misunderstandings, and to move forward with a clean slate. Life is too short to hold on to misconceptions and missed opportunities. It's time to embrace the reality, let go of illusions, and keep rocking as always.

<br>

In the spirit of self-discovery, I'm reminded of the profound teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. The ancient scripture emphasizes the concept of 'Karma Yoga,' teaching us to focus on our present actions without attachment to the results. In the context of my journey in Pune, it encourages me to let go of preconceived notions and judgments, understanding that people, like me, are on their unique paths of growth.

The Bhagavad Gita also underscores the importance of detaching from the past and future, emphasizing the significance of the present moment. Through this lens, my reflections on past friendships take on a new light â€“ a reminder to appreciate the evolving nature of relationships and cherish the current connections that contribute positively to my life.

In essence, the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita offer valuable insights into navigating the complexities of relationships and finding inner peace amidst life's twists and turns. As I move forward, I carry with me the wisdom of detachment and the understanding that every encounter, whether nostalgic or novel, contributes to the intricate tapestry of my personal journey.

<br>

Life is a journey, and we all change and grow. It's vital that we find people who embrace and celebrate the person we've become, and that we take the chance to meet and understand those we've only known through screens. Thank you, Pune, for this enlightening experience, and here's to a future filled with genuine connections and newfound clarity. ðŸŒ±

#### The Purpose of Writing This Blog:

Reflecting on my experiences in Pune and the emotional rollercoaster of reconnecting with old friends, I felt compelled to share these thoughts.

#### Conclusion:

In conclusion, life is a dynamic journey filled with twists and turns, and our relationships evolve just as we do. The trip to Pune was a poignant reminder that while some connections may fade, new ones can blossom. It's essential to appreciate the genuine connections, like my OG gang, and to approach relationships with an open heart, allowing room for growth and understanding. Here's to the ongoing adventure of life, filled with meaningful connections and the wisdom gained from each experience.

#### Update:

After these 2-3 months, things have been a little tough for me. I find myself contemplating whether I truly don't care about her anymore or if I've already moved on. Nevertheless, navigating this one-sided relationship has proven to be quite challenging. It's an experience I wouldn't wish upon anyone. One thing I've come to realize is that if someone has made up their mind about something, no amount of effort can change it. It doesn't matter how hard you try to convince them; they simply won't believe. After some time, you should recognize that there's no point in holding onto them anymore. This was a unique experience for me, and it took me some time to overcome it. I believe December 30, 2023, was the last day, but I've already moved on from it.

Some lessons I've learned: If someone doesn't fall in line with your values, it's best not to interact with them at all, not for the sake of showing off, but for your own well-being. Initially, detaching from her was incredibly difficult, but with time, it became a part of life.

In conclusion, I wish to express, "In your search, I found myself" This revelation holds profound significance for me, marking the culmination of my journey. It's a declaration that encapsulates a newfound sense of self-awareness and resolution. Henceforth, I commit to closing this chapter definitively. There will be no further interactionâ€”no calls, messages, or face-to-face meetings. This decision isn't born of animosity but rather a firm determination to move forward independently, honoring the journey of self-discovery that has led me to this moment.
