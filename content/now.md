I wanted to take a moment to share some exciting updates from my life. In August 2023, I made a big move from Delhi to Mumbai, and it's been quite an adventure so far.

I'm currently working as an SDE2 (Software Developer Engineer 2) at PepperMoney India. My focus is primarily on the mobile team, where we're working hard to develop the PepperMoney India mobile application. We recently launched the Pepper Money prepaid card, which has been a thrilling project to be a part of.

As for my hobbies, my interest in reading books has taken a back seat for now, and I'm loving the change of pace. Mumbai's beautiful beaches and vibrant city life have captured my heart. I'm currently in the process of figuring out new interests and activities to dive into.

During my free time, you can often find me strolling along Mumbai's stunning beaches, enjoying quality time with friends, or occasionally visiting temples to find some inner peace. I'm also making an effort to establish a healthy routine and prioritize fitness in my life.

Mumbai has welcomed me with open arms, and I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes me. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore this incredible city and embark on new adventures.
